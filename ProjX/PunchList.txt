CSimulation::CheckModel is misnamed as it changes the simulations state eg calling makeEquations.
Need to check a potential problem with constrained variables in solver. What about the half steps etc ?
Is this the right way to handle constrained variables ?

Perhaps should have them in at the equation level - looks a bit bolt on to me.
